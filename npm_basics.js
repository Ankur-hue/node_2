// NPM basically stands for Node Package Manager 

// It allows us to do 3 things :  1.To reuse our own code in the program ,  2. To use the code written by other developers , 3. Share our code with other developers 
// To install packages locally that is to use a package in a particular this project only then command is :
// npm i <packageName>
// Global dependency --> To use the package in any project 
// npm install -g <packageName>
// npm init -y command will simply creates a package.json file 

// package.json file contains all the packages that are installed as a dependencies 

// Packages that we install get stored as a dependency in package.json file . 

// Example here we have installed a loadsh package . and when we see the package.json file it automatically gets added into it 

// A folder named node_modules alreasy get created and it contains all the dependencies and related information . 

// Now we have installed a bigger package that is bootstrap. So along with bootstrap dependency all the other dependencies that bootstrap uses also gets added into the node_modules package .
